#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January? How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct cust.acctnum as Account
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(feb.orderID) = 6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select product, sum(quantity) as TotalSold, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct cust.acctnum) as TotalCust, round(avg(feb.Quantity*feb.Price), 2) as AvgSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(feb.orderID) = 6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

Select Product, sum(Quantity) as TotalSold
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
AND Product <> ''
